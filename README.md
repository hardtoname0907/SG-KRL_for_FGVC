## Abstract
Fine-grained visual classification aims to distinguish visually similar categories and plays a critical role in practical applications. However, it faces challenges such as difficulty in localizing key regions and interference from background noise. Most methods fail to exploit semantic information effectively. This work propose a fine-grained classification method based on Semantically Guided Key Region Localization(SG-KRL). We first use deep global semantic information to guide feature fusion, enabling precise localization and adaptive cropping of the primary object region. Then, we apply semantic weighting in both channel and spatial dimensions to enhance object features, followed by multi-scale window selection to identify key parts. Finally, a graph-based representation is constructed using the semantic relationships of window positions, ensuring reliable classification. Experiments on three public benchmarks show our method balances accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods. Additionally, we construct a luxury goods dataset containing genuine and counterfeit samples. Experiments on this dataset show high precision, demonstrating the method’s effectiveness in identifying subtle craftsmanship differences. Therefore, it can also contribute to intellectual property protection and combating illicit trade.
